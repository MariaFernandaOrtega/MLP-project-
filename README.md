# NLP Project
## Summary

One of the main challenges of the digital era is the difficulty of assessing the reliability of information sources. This project compares two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Passive-agressive) to detect fake news in two languages: English and Spanish. The data was obtained from the "ISOT Fake News" database, made available by the University of Victoria, Canada, for the english news, and  by web scraping data from  news websites for the Spanish news.  The results in both languages show a lower level of logistic regression performance compared to the passive aggressive classifier. The metrics used to measure performance are Accuracy and F1 Score, in addition to the confusion matrix and cross-validation to ensure the absence of bias during the training and adjustment phase.
